# KeyRemapping
This repository is a collection of various keyboard remapping scripts for Windows and Linux. Any files that end in .ahk are AutoHotkey scripts that depend on AutoHotkey v2. 

The main branch includes scripts that currently work and are in use on my Windows laptop.

The testing branch includes testing scripts that were used when first getting scripts working, saved for posterity.
